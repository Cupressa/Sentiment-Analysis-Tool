94| The system allowed students who may feel uncomfortable with traditional upper-level assignments to learn the same concepts in a welcoming environment. Since the game had already been developed, students could run the application at any time, rather than needing to wait until the code had been written and the bugs had been resolved. Students could also reference example material in order to ideate how to design their controller.| 0.80| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the welcoming learning environment and the availability of resources.

95| I had a hard goal of making the best performing ship in the class. I put likely well over the amount of time into the project than was strictly required in order to achieve that goal.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it highlights the dedication and goal-oriented effort.

96| I want to code video games, and knowing that this is at least an introduction to that was a huge motivator.

103| Every component was visible and able to be found, given enough search time.| 0.65| High| This is a mostly positive comment because it appreciates the visibility and findability of components despite the search time.

104| The code was organized by classes in a very understandable fashion. After a short amount of time familiarizing oneself with the code, it was easy to find any related functions one may need in order to develop their controller.| 0.80| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the understandable organization and ease of finding related functions.

105| All of the code is there. If I wanted to learn about making ship controllers, I would've rather built the program up myself as trying to figure it out was too much for me. I would be all for it in a job sense because I'm getting paid but in college I want to learn how to do something not guess and try to make something off of what someone else made as it's harder for me to really learn and know a project without being there for every aspect.| 0.40| High| This is a slightly negative comment because it expresses a preference for building from scratch and criticizes the difficulty of learning without full involvement.

106| I chose overwhelming because at first I was lost in the complexity of the problem. There were many different parts to the program and it took me a while to understand what was important/needed to complete my ship controller.| 0.45| High| This is a slightly negative comment because it describes the initial overwhelming complexity and the time taken to understand.

107| It was a lot to wrap my head around. I wish there had been a little more demonstration on how to approach that project. Maybe a short video online I could have revisited to see someone else using the code. The most difficult part of the project was just wrapping my head around how to use the pre-existing code.| 0.45| High| This is a slightly negative comment because it describes the overwhelming nature and suggests the need for more demonstrations.

108| It was quite a bit to be thrown into in the last 3 weeks to a month of class, figuring out where all to go was a solid portion of working in it.| 0.40| High| This is a slightly negative comment because it describes the overwhelming nature and the significant time spent figuring things out.

109| Given enough competition, pitting spaceships against other students' is an engaging way to focus on dissimilar strategies, thinking critically about how to address the other person's algorithm. In a similar vein, this assignment is one of few where students are openly (and not altogether critically) invited to compare and contrast with other students to try and get an edge.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the engaging and critical thinking aspects of the competition.

110| A lot of students I've encountered are interested in game design. Doing a coding project based around something besides data manipulation or mathematics is refreshing.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the refreshing change to game design from usual coding projects.

111| At a point in the Cyber Systems education where nearly if not all projects/assignments were built from the ground up by students, this was a project requiring you to familiarize yourself with a sizable existing project structure and add to it which to me is extremely relevant to a developer job.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the relevance to real-world developer jobs.

112| The project applied knowledge from the course itself.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it acknowledges the practical application of course knowledge.

127| The project allowed me to learn new skills and see what goes into a game like this.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the opportunity to learn new skills.

128| The project itself required a lot of thinking beyond normal procedure. Order of operations, hierarchy of decisions, and so on.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it acknowledges the complex and thoughtful nature of the project.

129| The project really required me to want to dig in and learn about how everything in the system worked to try and create the best ship that I could. This made it very engaging for me.| 0.80| High| This is a positive comment because it highlights the engaging and deep learning experience.

130| The task is stimulating in that it demands outside-the-box thinking. Instead of merely achieving expected results for an algorithm, this engages the student to find their own limit and expectation.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the stimulating and creative thinking required.

131| This assignment really got me to think as to how everything works in the given system. What best ship would do well in that environment and how to implement it.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it acknowledges the deep thinking and understanding required.

132| I chose straightforward because it was very easy to pick up. What we had to do was simple, but there was the option to make it as complex as we like.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the straightforward nature and the flexibility in complexity.

133| I would like to see run this big project running with different new applications because eclipse is old.| 0.60| High| This is a mixed comment because it acknowledges the value of the project but criticizes the use of Eclipse.

134| No nonsense and straight to the point.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the straightforward and no-nonsense approach.

135| Once you find all the methods and how to call them the implementation seems to be fairly straightforward.| 0.70| High| This is a mostly positive comment because it acknowledges the straightforward nature of the implementation once familiarized.

136| Once you got the hang of things and how they work, it became easier to work and shape the ship. The assignment in itself was fairly straightforward as well. Make a ship controller.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the ease and straightforward nature of the assignment once understood.

137| Above reasons, along with unclear minimum decision making needed.| 0.40| High| This is a slightly negative comment because it acknowledges previous positive points but criticizes the unclear decision-making requirements.

138| Because I couldn't find motivation for it, I did not see any value in it, and it was intimidating, it had me stressing over even doing the project to the point where I was in tears a couple of times. The fear of having to retake the class as well as the fact that I couldn't bring myself to work on the project most of the time.| 0.20| High| This is a very negative comment because it describes a lack of motivation, perceived value, and significant stress.

139| There were times where I could figure out certain problems, but most of them were resolved after a while.| 0.60| High| This is a mixed comment because it acknowledges some initial difficulty but eventual resolution of problems.

140| (not in a bad way) Just can take a lot of time if you aren't sure how to go about things.| 0.55| High| This is a mixed comment because it acknowledges the time-consuming nature without strong negative sentiment.

141| Above reasons.| 0.50| Low| This is a neutral comment because it refers to previous reasons without adding new information.

142| It was a big project to take on... it could've saved us time if there was an introduction to the project earlier in the semester for us to become acclimated with the entire program and what functions were available so that we might've had more time to develop our controllers instead of trying to figure out how to do basic maneuvers.| 0.45| High| This is a slightly negative comment because it acknowledges the value of the project but criticizes the timing and initial introduction.

143| The project took a lot of time even though I had fun with it.| 0.65| High| This is a mostly positive comment because it acknowledges the fun despite the time-consuming nature.

144| Time-consuming goes along with the motivating part as well. I wouldn't call it overly time-consuming. A student could produce a functional ship with 1-2 weeks of mildly focused work. But because I wanted my ship to be the best, I sunk a considerable amount of time into it. Which I believe was beneficial.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the beneficial and motivating aspects despite the time commitment.

145| Trying to successfully implement features required lots of trial and error and adjusting the code just right.

151| Originally I intended to describe how one cannot predict how their spaceship will compare to others' when fighting. However, I might also point out that the exercise as a whole may be unpredictable as it relies on the participation and interest of the students. They may choose not to be challenged, instead opting to create very simple spaceships.| 0.60| High| This is a mixed comment because it acknowledges the unpredictability and variability in student participation and interest.

152| Sometimes the ship in the project would not work how you wanted it to and you wouldn't know why.| 0.40| High| This is a slightly negative comment because it describes frustration with the ship not working as expected.

153| It was, without a doubt, able to be used. I wouldn't say it was an incredibly enjoyable experience trying to dig through and find what to tweak all the time, but the code was well commented and partitioned well, so this was likely just an issue of interacting with a large project.| 0.60| High| This is a mixed comment because it acknowledges the usability and well-commented code but criticizes the enjoyment of finding tweaks in a large project.

154| Once I understood how the game worked, it was easy to use and implement my ship.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the ease of use and implementation once understood.

155| The examples that were provided were very usable, in the sense that it showed how to implement some of the basic needs of the ship controller.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the usability of provided examples.

156| Because you constantly practice with code and keeps you remembering things from the past class of my major.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the continuous practice and reinforcement of past learning.

157| I felt that I had learned a great amount during the period of the project.| 0.80| High| This is a positive comment because it highlights the significant learning experience.

158| Implementing the controller in such a dynamic environment is useful because it's unique. It requires creative thinking. The code library at any business is also going to be unique and have its own nuances and solutions. So, developing in a dynamic environment is useful to prepare for code we might encounter in a professional setting.| 0.80| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the unique and useful experience for professional preparation.

159| It helped to solidify my understanding of the techniques used in software development.| 0.80| High| This is a positive comment because it acknowledges the solidification of software development techniques.

160| It is a good chance to know a big project.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the opportunity to work on a large project.

161| Same as relevant. It allowed a programming environment that already existed that we had to adapt to, and add to. I don't know how many projects in entry-level programming jobs have a programmer building things from scratch versus adding to existing projects but I would guess it's not many. It's very useful to be able to understand someone else's code and add to it when required.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the practical and useful experience of adapting and adding to existing projects.

162| The skills developed in that project are fundamental to programming in general. They're important to learn.| 0.80| High| This is a positive comment because it highlights the fundamental and important skills learned.

163| I chose 'valuable' because this project helped me learn more about data structures and how to best use them to give a desired outcome.| 0.80| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the valuable learning about data structures.

164| I chose valuable because it seemed like a worthy final for this class.| 0.80| High| This is a positive comment because it acknowledges the worthiness of the project as a final assignment.

165| I could do something over a big project.| 0.70| Medium| This is a mostly positive comment because it acknowledges the value of working on a big project.

166| I feel that the knowledge gained from the project can also be used down the road in different courses as well as in future employment.| 0.80| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the long-term value of the knowledge gained.

167| I think seeing a full system/game like this is extremely valuable, especially learning how to work inside one with other people.| 0.85| High| This is a very positive comment because it appreciates the valuable experience of working within a full system/game with others.

168| I thought the experience as a whole was very valuable to my computer science education.| 0.85| High| This is a very positive comment because it acknowledges the overall value to computer science education.

169| It gave a more realistic example of something one might encounter when working for a company, a pre-existing system that they have to add things to.| 0.80| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the realistic experience relevant to working for a company.

170| See: Useful.| 0.75| Low| This is a neutral comment because it refers to previous positive points without adding new information.

171| Though I don't know that this assignment specifically 'taught' me anything about data structures and algorithms, I thought it was a very entertaining application of them. I think having the opportunity to implement and reflect on the efficiency of my algorithm was valuable.| 0.75| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the entertaining application and valuable reflection opportunity.

172| Working with a bigger project like this was a lot more rewarding than doing lots of little projects that don't mean much to students at the end of the day. It seems like something that could actually be applied to the real world.| 0.80| High| This is a positive comment because it appreciates the rewarding and real-world applicability of the project.
