2,0.75,0.75,High," The sentiment is mostly positive as the choice of words denotes useful, fast and educational elements implying a functional and beneficial situation. The only negative sentiment mentioned is 'confusing' and that was explained to have been resolved throughout the user experience. So, while there is a note of initial confusion, the user has highlighted that they found clarity, which is actually a positive outcome.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,0.67,0.65,Medium," The sentiment is generally mixed in the batch, leaning slightly towards positive due to words like 'usable' and 'easy to use'. Nonetheless, the negative words 'time-consuming', 'boring', and 'dull' bring down the overall score slightly.

5,0.7,0.8,High," The sentiment analysis score of the combined words points towards a somewhat positive sentiment largely due to words such as 'clean', 'clear', 'business-like', and 'professional' which generally induce a sense of positivity and satisfaction. However, the presence of words like 'incomprehensible', 'complex', and 'too technical' lowers the sentiment indicating confusion and difficulty. After adjusting for the explanations though, it is evident that the negative emotions stems mainly from a lack of understanding about a specific topic (grasshoppers) and not necessarily from the words themselves. Therefore, this raises the sentiment score to 0.80, reflecting a largely positive sentiment but taking into account the frustration from the lack of understanding on certain topics.'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The explanations reinforce this positivity, emphasizing clarity ('not a lot of excess graphics to distract'), simplicity and precision ('very direct questions, easy to understand'), and approachability ('one question per-page",,,,,,,,,,,, easy to follow'). As such, the overall original sentiment is strong (0.85). But, considering the positive connotations within the explanations, the sentiment score slightly increases (0.90).',
7,0.75,0.85,High,"'Overall, the words and the explained context for them all display a positive sentiment. Words such as 'stimulating', 'usable', 'straightforward', 'fun', 'innovative' generally carry a favorable tone. The explanations provided further the positive sentiment, describing the subject to have qualities such as interesting, easy to use, direct, cool and ingenuitive. The adjusted score is therefore higher than the original to account for this added positive sentiment in the explanations.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,0.7,0.8,Medium,"'The words in isolation have a slightly more negative sentiment, with words like 'dated','boring', and 'dull' which could be associated with a lack of interest or excitement. However, words such as 'straightforward' and 'simple' have more neutral to positive connotations, contributing to overall simplification and understanding. The explanations tend to amplify the sentiment of the words slightly, particularly with 'straightforward' and 'simple' where the explanations suggest clearness and ease of understanding. Explanation of 'dated', 'boring', and 'dull' also intensify the negative sentiments, adding more details indicating lack of excitement or deficiencies in design or content.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,0.85,0.9,High," The overall sentiment of the word choices and explanation is positive. The term 'easy' indicates a lack of difficulty or effort, suggesting a positive user experience, while 'fairly' slightly dilutes this positivity.

Words like 'responsive' and 'usable' express a sense of satisfaction towards the program, indicating a positive sentiment. On the other hand, terms such as 'complex', 'time-consuming', and 'awkward' suggest difficulty using the program, implying a less positive sentiment. However, in the given context and provided explanations, these negative words are more reflective of the user's perceived difficulty rather than a negative attitude towards the program itself.

After adjusting considering the explanations, the sentiment score was changed to (0.98). The explanations added extra positive context, enhancing the original positive sentiment. Each feedback seems to be from users who appreciated the simplicity, practicality, usability, clarity and enjoyment of a digital platform.

This leads to high confidence in the adjusted score.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,0.3,0.4,Medium,"'The sentiment is generally neutral, leaning towards negative due to words like 'time-consuming', 'awkward' and 'old'. However, the word 'comprehensive' does offer some positivity which increases the adjusted sentiment score slightly. The explanations provided for 'time-consuming' and 'awkward' seem to detract from user experience adding a negative tone, while 'old' typically has negative connotations.

17,0.85,0.95,High,"'The original score is given a high value,0.85, as the words entertaining and fun both represent positive emotions.

The confidence level is high as these words clearly exhibit positive sentiments.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,0.7,0.6,medium,"'The words provided evoke mixed sentiments. Some of the words like 'impressive' and 'interesting idea' have positive connotations, indicating approval or fascination, thus having a high sentiment score. 'Simplistic' and 'user friendly' also imply something positive, however 'simplistic' could also be interpreted as lacking sophistication which can lower the sentiment score. 'Too technical', 'confusing', and 'vague' are seen as negatives, lowering the overall sentiment score. The explanations provided generally help to clarify the context, but in the case of 'too technical' it implies a higher barrier to access or understanding, further reducing the sentiment score. 'Confusing due to technical terminology' lowers the sentiment as well. 'Vague for weather stations' does not provide enough context to significantly impact the sentiment score.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,0.75,0.8,High,"'The selected words are typically associated with positive sentiments and they have been presented in positive contexts, implying a good user experience with an application or process. The sentiments have an original score averaging to 0.75; however, based on the explanatory phrases, which pointed to additional satisfaction such as ease of use, relevance, quick results, and logical flow, the overall sentiment score has been slightly adjusted upwards to 0.80.

Hence, the adjusted score is slightly higher than the initial one.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,0.8,0.86,High,"'Overall the sentiments expressed in the words seem largely positive even with the inclusion of the neutral 'old'. Although 'old' usually would carry a negative sentiment, its associated comment about the menu panel looking out of date does not necessarily denote a negative feeling, but a suggestion for improvement.

While 'understandable' tends to hold a neutral to positive sentiment, the context provided in the explanation implies a sense of confusion or displeasure, which slightly lowers the adjusted score.
