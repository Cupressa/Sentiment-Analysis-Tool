Even positive terms like effortless and clear are presented in a way that suggests they are negative - perhaps the effortlessness is due to lack of depth or excitement and the clarity is due to over-simplicity.'

47,'0.15,0.20,Medium,The sentiment analysis score is rather low due to the negative sentiment carried by words such as 'frustrating', 'confusing', and 'poor quality'.

For example, the 'awkward' layout could be corrected with standardization, the 'useful' tool expands general knowledge, the 'fast' tool ensures quick responses, the 'vague' tool could still be useful despite initial ambiguity, and even though the program was 'confusing' at first, it appears that was more due to a lack of initial information rather than the program's design.'

For instance, 'vague' is used in a negative context affecting the map quality, and 'time-consuming' indicates a negative user-experience with too much clicking, lowering the adjusted score. Although the 'customizable' nature contributes to the 'time-consuming' aspect, it is still used in a generally positive context, pointing to individual tunability.
