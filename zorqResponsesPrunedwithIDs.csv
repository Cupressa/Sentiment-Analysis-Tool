2,Accessible,The use of a game environment contextualized thinking with algorithms in a way that most students were familiar with.,
2,Appealing,It was unconvential and an enjoyable change from regular lesson structure.,
2,Fun,The autonomy offered by the project and the uncertainty of how your ship would stack up against your classmates were two aspects that were very enjoyable.,
2,Inviting,The project elicited the same emotions from me that a game would such as a competitive desire to win by further understanding the mechanics. This led to a deeper evaluation of the game rules and what algorithms I could use.,
2,Stimulating,I had a genuine interest in the project which made participating in it more engaging than other projects which felt more like work.,
3,Customizable,"The task of creating your own spaceship to navigate and combat others seems to be one of the most customizable assignments we experience in the department. Many tasks involve writing code to meet specifications. Here, we have the requirement of envisioning a theoretical goal to achieve an amorphous endgame. It challenges us to find the best of what we can do and envision.",
3,Personal,"Given enough competition, pitting spaceships against other students is an engaging way to focus on dissimilar strategies, thinking critically about how to address the other persons algorithm. In a similar vein, this assignment is one of few where students are openly (and not altogether critically) invited to compare and contrast with other students to try and get an edge.",
3,Stimulating,"The task is stimulating in that it demands outside-the-box thinking. Instead of merely achieving expected results for an algorithm, this engages the student to find their own limit and expectation.",
3,Unconventional,This assignment is unlike many of the other tasks we see in the undergraduate curriculum. It almost endeavors to inject fun into the classroom in an unexpected way.,
3,Unpredictable,"Originally I intended to describe how one cannot predict how their spaceship will compare to others when fighting. However, I might also point out that the exercise as a whole may be unpredictable as it relies on the participation and interest of the students. They may choose not to be challenged, instead opting to create very simple spaceships. ",
4,Accessible,"Although it was a much bigger project than others Id worked on prior and thus required quite a bit of reading and digesting, I felt it was organized in such a way that someone whose abilities are at the CSIT 330 level should be able to complete it.",
4,Comprehensive,"Being larger and more complex than other projects I had worked on, it required a fairly thorough understanding of all the skills a student should have acquired up to that point.",
4,Fun,"It was very enjoyable to work on. In fact, I would say it probably ties for my favorite project that I completed throughout my studies.",
4,Useful,It helped to solidify my understanding of the techniques used in software development.,

6,Complex,"Many parts, using eclipse made it worse - had to learn all aspects of assignment including IDE. ",
6,Frustrating,There were no comments on the provided code. ,
6,Hard to use,"No comments, had to use eclipse which didnt work well on my computer. ",
6,Stressful,"Above reasons, along with unclear minimum decision making needed. ",
6,Time-consuming,Above reasons. ,
7,Fun,I had a good time completing the project. The competitiveness was motivating. ,
7,Relevant,The project applied knowledge from the course itself.,
7,Stimulating,Having your own ideas and implementing them was stimulating. ,
7,Useful,I felt that I had learned a great amount during the period of the project. ,
7,Valuable,I feel that the knowledge gained from the project will can also be used down the road in different courses as well as in future employment.,
8,Comprehensive,We used lots of different elements in the program.,
8,Customizable,You got to choose what feature to add to your ship.,
8,Exciting,It was exciting to watch the ships battle!,
8,Fun,It was fun to watch the ships battle!,
8,Valuable,I thought the experience as a whole was very valuable to my computer science education.,
9,Complex,We went from editing programs with minimal classes to trying to understand one with 30+ ,
9,Comprehensive,Tried to incorporate most of what we learned throughout the semester,
9,Confusing,Same complex,
9,Fun,Though a challenge at first to understand what was going on in the program and how to maneuver the controller it became a challenge to overcome certain challenging obstacles in the code.,
9,Time-consuming,It was a big project to take on... it couldve saved us time if there was an introduction to the project earlier in the semester for us to become acclimated with the entire program and what functions were available so that we mightve had more time to develop our controllers instead of trying to figure out how do basic maneuvers.,
10,Collaborative,"Students, including myself, would collaborate with others when problems occurred, or to share ideas on how to better optimize certain procedures.",
10,Complex,The system certainly had a lot of variables and possible approaches to creating a ship. Keeping them all in check was a complicated balancing act.,
10,Intimidating,The initial scale of possible things to do is a bit menacing. A basics guide (written or video) would help ease into the project better.,
10,Relevant,A lot of students Ive encountered are interested in game design. Doing a coding project based around something besides data manipulation or mathematics is refreshing.,
10,Stimulating,"The project itself required a lot of thinking beyond normal procedure. Order of operations, hierarchy of decisions, and so on. ",
11,Customizable,I chose customizable because I was able to customize the controller to do what I wanted it to do. I was able to choose the best strategy for my controller so I could get the most points.,
11,Empowering,I chose empowering because by working on this project I gained confidence in myself as a programmer. I was able to see my problem-solving skills and hard work pay off when we battled in class. ,
11,Overwhelming,I chose overwhelming because at first I was lost in the complexity of the problem. There were many different parts to the program and it took me a while to understand what was important/needed to complete my ship controller.  ,
11,Stimulating,"I chose stimulating because this project made me think. I had to dissect the program to understand what parts I needed to use, and I had to conceive and implement a strategy for my controller based on what I had available. ",
11,Valuable,I chose valuable because this project helped me learn more about data structures and how to best use them to give a desired outcome. ,

14,Fresh,It was one of the most exciting and unique projects I did in undergraduate. ,
14,Fun,"I like competitive games, and this was a great way to have friendly competition within the class. ",
14,Motivating,"Since its a class competition, it gives a lot of motivation for the students to do their best since everyone wants to win. ",
14,Stimulating,It required everyone to really think about not only their code but what everyone elses code might be like. It also forces students to make unique project solutions since the problem is unique to the class. ,

17,Accessible,This project was an accessible introduction to bigger software projects.,
17,Fun,Its fun to make your ship do something unique and interesting.,
17,Relevant,This was relevant because it has a similar structure to more complex software projects.,
17,Stimulating,It was stimulating to put together the pieces from the assignment and create them into your own work.,
17,Valuable,I chose valuable because it seemed like a worthy final for this class.,
18,Complex,I felt like I could do a lot of complex things with the ship if I had the time to implement these things.,
18,Connected,I felt like it was easy to connect my ship to the game world.,
18,Exciting,It was exciting to add something I created to a pre-existing system.,
18,Usable,"Once I understood how the game worked, it was easy to use and implement my ship.",
18,Valuable,"It gave a more realistic example of something one might encounter when working for a company, a pre-existing system that they have to add things to.",
19,Appealing,It was like playing a video game but rather than using a controller you developed code and implemented a strategy using the algorithms and data structures we had been learning about all semester.,
19,Customizable,Each student was able to customize the ships instructions their own way making each strategy something different.,
19,Fun,"While I was learning more about coding by learning the system and coding my algorithm, it didnt seem like coding as I was enjoying the time I spent working on the project.",
19,Motivating,I was motivated by the thrill of competition. I wanted to do well and try and have the best ship of the top ships in the class.,
19,Stimulating,The project really required me to want to dig in and learn about how everything in the system worked to try and create the best ship that I could. This made it very engaging for me.,
20,Comprehensive,I had to use a lot of information from previous classes as well as this one to complete the project. ,
20,Intimidating,"The project seemed like a lot to do at first, so it was hard to know where to start. ",
20,Stimulating,The project allowed me to learn new skills and see what goes into a game like this. ,
20,Stressful,"There were times where I could figure out certain problems, but most of them were resolved after a while. ",

22,Exciting,It was fun to see a visible manifestation of my codes behavior for the first time. ,
22,Fun,I enjoyed the concept and competing with my classmates. ,
22,Overwhelming,It was a lot to wrap my head around. I wish there had been a little more demonstration on how to approach that project. Maybe a short video online I could have revisited to see someone else using the code. The most difficult part of the project was just wrapping my head around how to use the pre-existing code. ,
22,Useful,The skills developed in that project are fundamental to programming in general. Theyre important to learn. ,
23,Collaborative,"I worked with other students while we all figured out how this system worked, and applied it to our individual ships.",
23,Complex,The code base we were using was a lot larger than other programs weve used before.,
23,Exciting,"It was fun to watch the ships go head to head, and try to come up with strategies to make them perform better.",
23,Frustrating,"Since the code base we started with was bigger than we were used to, it was sometimes frustrating to figure out what to do or where to look - but that frustration also made it more engaging.",
23,Valuable,Working with a bigger project like this was a lot more rewarding than doing lots of little projects that dont mean much to students at the end of the day. It seems like something that could actually be applied to the real world.,

27,Relevant,,
28,Appealing,Planning a strategy to achieve a goal in a game environment was very interesting to me,
28,Motivating,I had a hard goal of making the best performing ship in the class.  I put likely well over the amount of time in to the project than was strictly required in order to achieve that goal.,
28,Relevant,"At a point in the Cyber Systems education where nearly if not all projects/assignments were built from the ground up by students, this was a project requiring you to familiarize yourself with a sizable existing project structure and add to it which to me is extremely relevant to a developer job.",
28,Time-consuming,"time-consuming goes along with the motivating part as well.  I wouldnt call it overly time consuming.  A student could produce a functional ship with 1-2 weeks of mildly focused work.  But because I wanted my ship to be the best, I sunk a considerable amount of time into it.  Which i believe was beneficial.",
28,Useful,"same as relevant.  It allowed an programming environment that already existed that we had to adapt to, and add to.  I dont know how many projects in entry level programming jobs have a programmer building things from scratch versus adding to existing projects but I would guess its not many.  Its very useful to be able to understand someone elses code and add to it when required.",

32,Overwhelming,"It was quite a bit this be thrown into in the last 3 weeks to a month of class, figuring out where all to go was a solid portion of working in it.",
32,Usable,"It was, without a doubt, able to be used. I wouldnt say it was an incredibly enioyable experience trying to dig through and find what to tweak all the time, but the code was well commented and partitioned well, so this was likely just an issue of interacting with a large project.",
33,Attractive,It is nice to work with all my classmates.,
33,Exciting,It is exciting to have a ship competition.,
33,Motivating,We all want our ship to be the best one.,
33,Useful,It is a good chance to know a big project.,
33,Valuable,I could do something over a big project.,
34,Customizable,You could make your ship do whatever you wanted to do.,
34,Exciting,It was exciting to see how your programming would work against others,
34,Frustrating,It was difficult and frustrating at times but it got you to think about what was going on.,
34,High quality,The game was well put together and easily allowed anyone to implement a controller.,
34,Stimulating,It was different than anything Ive ever done before and interesting. It really made me think and understand what the code meant.,
35,Gets in the way,It was getting in the way of my mental health with my other finals and me stressing.,
35,Intimidating,I had zero motivation to do this project nor did I view it valuable for computer programming.,
35,Not valuable,I have a couple years of computer programming experience in a work environment and it is nothing like the game. And I will never want to be a game programmer so it didnt interest me. ,
35,Overwhelming,"All of the code is there. If I wanted to learn about making ship controllers, I wouldve rather built the program up myself as trying to figure it out was too much for me. I would be all for it in a job sense because Im getting paid but in college I want to learn how to do something not guess and try to make something off of what someone else made as its harder for me to really learn and know a project without being there for every aspect.",
35,Stressful,"Because I couldnt find motivation for it, I did not see any value in it, and it was intimidating, it had me stressing over even doing the project to the point where I was in tears a couple times. The fear of having to retake the class as well as the fact that I couldnt bring myself to work on the project most of the time. ",
36,Accessible,"It was cool to be able to dive into such a complex project and be given a small, accessible task- a controller.",
36,Fresh,"I dont think we have done any other programming assignments that were so directly competitive, and I enjoyed that challenge!",
36,Fun,"This ties into my other answer, but I was very engaged in this assignment because it was strategic and competitive.",
36,Stimulating,Same reasons I chose fun, it was not hard to sink time into because it felt more like a hobby.
36,Valuable,"Though I dont know that this assignment specifically taught me anything about data structures and algorithms, I thought it was a very entertaining application of them. I think having the opportunity to implement and reflect on the efficiency of my algorithm was valuable.",
37,Appealing,"Im hoping to be able to code video games, so this is a great introduction to that. ",
37,Complex,"When I first looked at the code for the overall game, it was a lot. There is a lot of aspects that I havent had much experience with. ",
37,Fun,It was fun to problem solve and find why my ship was not doing what it was supposed to. ,
37,Intimidating,"Like I said with complex, it was a lot. On the outside looking in, coding a ship that is  able to act correctly for every single instance seems intimidating. In practice it is much simpler than I thought it was going to be. ",
37,Motivating,"I want to code video games, and knowing that this is at least an introduction to that was a huge motivator. It also showcased that I do have the ability to work with things like this. ",

41,Straight forward,Once you find all the methods and how to call them the implamentation seems to be fairly straightforward. ,
41,Usable,"The examples that were provided were very usable, in the sence that it showed how to implament some of the basic needs of the ship controller.",
41,Valuable,"I think seeing a full system / game like this is extreamly valuable, especially learning how to work inside one with other people. ",

43,Easy to use,"Because the mainframe of the game was already set up, it made it a lot easier to program.",
43,Stimulating,Makes you think about how to go about certain action,
43,Straight forward,No nonsense and straight to the point,
43,Time-consuming,(not in a bad way)  Just can take a lot of time if you arent sure how to go about things,
44,Customizable,Lots of different ways to make the ship,
44,Fresh,Ive never done something like this before ,
44,Fun,I had a lot of fun doing the project,
44,Stimulating,I had to really think and the project stimulated the mind,
44,Time-consuming,The project took a lot of time even though I had fun with it,
45,Easy to use,"The systems nomenclature effectively described its functions. The code was organized well, which allowed the user to easily find related functions. Dr. Hastings showed us a simplistic, example ship controller which allowed us to model a more advanced ship controller after it.",
45,Fun,"The idea of a computer game is a more enjoyable assignment for most people than I assume other data structure/algorithm assignments would be. Additionally, it is fun to watch your ship controller compete against the ship controllers of your classmates.",
45,Inviting,"The system allowed students who may feel uncomfortable with traditional upper-level assignments to learn the same concepts in a welcoming environment. Since the game had already been developed, students could run the application at any time, rather than needing to wait until the code had been written and the bugs had been resolved. Students could also reference example material in order to ideate how to design their controller. ",
45,Organized,"The code was organized by classes in a very understandable fashion. After a short amount of time familiarizing oneself with the code, it was easy to find any related functions one may need in order to develop their controller.",
45,Unconventional,"The assignment itself seemed unconventional for a project in this course. Nevertheless, I think important concepts can be learned from the unconventional approach. By assigning a final project that was very enjoyable to students, I think many people put more effort into, and learned more from, the assignment than they would have otherwise.",
46,Exciting,Because I love to learn new things and this is one of the projects challenges but also have fun at same time,
46,High quality,Its very sophisticated because Dr Hastings is keeping updating and changes eventually even though he gives same assignments every period ,
46,Intimidating,"Sometimes I felt overwhelmed due to the fact, that is hard to track the classes because its so much to learn . I think that should exist a guideline to keep in track everything ",
46,Straight forward,I would like to see run this big project running with different new applications because eclipse is old,
46,Useful,Because you constantly practice with code and keeps you remembering things from the past class of my major,
47,Exciting,"When I would successfully implement a feature, it would really boost my morale seeing myself make noticeable progress ",
47,Intimidating,"When I first downloaded eclipse and Im ported the code, I was really intimidated By all the lines of code. I wasnt sure where to start. ",
47,Motivating,Learning how to navigate the environment and implement an algorithm for the controller feels rewarding and motivating to keep working,
47,Time-consuming,Trying to successfully implement features required lots of trial and error and adjusting the code just right. Its a time commitment to build the controller into the game environment ,
47,Useful,"Implementing the controller in such a dynamic environment is useful because its unique. It requires creative thinking. The code library at any business is also going to be unique and have its own nuances and solutions. So, developing in a dynamic environment is useful to prepare for code we might encounter in a professional setting",
48,Comprehensive,I chose comprehensive because it gave the opportunity to use a wide array of different topics to complete the task.,
48,Exciting,"I chose exciting because it was a project that drew me in, and I spent time on it because I wanted to, not because I had to. ",
48,Fun,I chose fun because I had a lot of fun completing the project. It was perhaps the most fun that I have ever had on a school project.,
48,Straight forward,"I chose straight forward because it was very easy to pick up. What we had to do was simple, but there was the option to make it as complex as we like.",
48,Unconventional,I chose unconventional because it is not the typical type of project that is given. I have never done anything else quite like this for a school related project.,
49,Accessible,"While it was a little difficult at the start to find the way everything works, there were plenty of example controllers and code to look through allowing you to figure stuff out.",
49,Consistent,Each ship and object worked in their intended ways every time. They had guidelines that they followed only spawning and moving in certain ways.,
49,Customizable,We were given the task of creating our own controller no matter what it did. As long as you could explain its strategy and there was effort behind it you could do whatever.,
49,Stimulating,This assignment really got me to think as to how everything works in the given system. What best ship would do well in that environment and how to implement it.,
49,Straight forward,"Once you got the hand of things and how they work, it became easier to work and shape the ship. The assignment in itself was fairly straight forward as well. Make a ship controller.",
50,Comprehensive,Because it included things that we learned during the semester. ,
50,Connected,Because it kept me connected and engaged to the system,
50,Fun,It was fun to play with it after finishing. ,
50,Motivating,It motivated me to get better ranking,
50,Stimulating,It stimulates me to make a better controller,
